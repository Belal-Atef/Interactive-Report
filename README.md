# Interactive-Report

Introducing an innovative program, "ZINTERACTIVE_REPORT," which highlights my proficiency in ABAP development.
This dynamic report enables seamless exploration of essential employee information without mentioning specific details.
By clicking on values, users can effortlessly navigate through various sections, including basic employee details,
salary information, and address details. This project demonstrates my expertise in interactive reporting and 
my commitment to delivering user-centric solutions.
